Take note that our master branch is our active, unstable development branch and that if you're looking to download a stable copy of the repo, check the [tagged downloads](https://github.com/connors/photon/tags).

### What's included

We provide compiled CSS (`photon.*`). We also include the Entypo fonts and a template Electron application for you to quickly get started.

## Documentation

Photon's documentation is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://photonkit.com>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.5.x).
  * **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.
2. Install the Ruby-based syntax highlighter, [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), with `gem install rouge`.
3. From the root `/photon` directory, run `Jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser and boom!

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Photon is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility **bumps the major** while resetting minor and patch
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility **bumps the minor** while resetting the patch
* Bug fixes and misc changes **bumps only the patch**
