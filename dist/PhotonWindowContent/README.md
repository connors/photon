# Window Content

The `<window-content>` element is used to define the window's real content after the header toolbar and before the footer toolbar.
It is recommended to use it within the `<ph-window>` element.

```html
<ph-window>
  ...
  <window-content>
    ...
  </window-content>
  ...
</ph-window>
```
